# Implementation-of-Linear-Regression-for-Predicting-Car-Prices
## AIM:
To write a program to predict car prices using a linear regression model and test the assumptions for linear regression.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Import the standard Libraries.

2.Set variables for assigning dataset values.

3.Import linear regression from sklearn.

4.Assign the points for representing in the graph.

5.Predict the regression for the marks by using the representation of the graph.

6.Compare the graphs and hence we obtained the linear regression for the given datas

## Program:
```
/*

```

## Output:
![simple linear regression model for predicting the marks scored](sam.png)


## Result:
Thus, the program to implement a linear regression model for predicting car prices is written and verified using Python programming, along with the testing of key assumptions for linear regression.
